# https---github.com-alnahian37-Conditional-GAN-for-Face-Generation-with-5-attributes
In this project the goal is to implement a conditional Generative Adversial Network (cGAN) that can generate human faces with certain conditions applied to the appearance of the generated images. We have used a modified version of the CelebA dataset which contains 202,559 images with 40 attributes. In our case, the dataset image size was cropped to 64x64x3 sizes and we had to consider 5 out of 40 attributes for conditional information.
In our case we have used the cGAN to generate human faces having different attributes. The attributes selected was Black hair, Male-female, Oval Shaped Face, Smiling, Young. So, an input attribute of 10011 should generate a face which has black hair, is a female, not oval shaped face, smiling and young. In the generated images, one or more of the attributes are present based on the user input during the generation process.
