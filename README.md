# https---github.com-alnahian37-Conditional-GAN-for-Face-Generation-with-5-attributes
In this project the goal is to implement a conditional Generative Adversial Network (cGAN) that can generate human faces with certain conditions applied to the appearance of the generated images. We have used a modified version of the CelebA dataset which contains 202,559 images with 40 attributes. In our case, the dataset image size was cropped to 64x64x3 sizes and we had to consider 5 out of 40 attributes for conditional information.
In our case we have used the cGAN to generate human faces having different attributes. The attributes selected was Black hair, Male, Oval Shaped Face, Smiling, Young. In the generated images, one or more of the attributes are present based on the user input during the generation process.
